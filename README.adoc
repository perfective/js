= Perfective JavaScript

== Development

To maintain productive development environment with the WebStorm IDE,
this project sets a group `tsconfig.json` files.
The base file with the TypeScript compiler configuration is `tsconfig.strict.json`.
It contains all the default compiler settings.
The root `tsconfig.json` contains the `paths` list,
so WebStorm can pick them up in the packages' imports before the build.
Packages do *not* have `tsconfig.json`,
as the `paths` can be set only for the files included in the project.
When `tsconfig.json` provided in the package,
WebStorm picks it up as the default configuration,
and breaks the `paths` option recognition.
Instead, there is a `tslint.build.json` file for each package,
that extends `tsconfig.strict.json` directly
and is used for the build.
Each package also contains an additional `tslint.lint.json` file,
which does extend the rootÂ `tsconfig.json` to pick up the `paths` configuration,
`.eslintrc.json` explicitly uses `tslint.lint.json` for linting configuration.
