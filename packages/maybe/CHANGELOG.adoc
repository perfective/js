= Changelog

== v0.5.0-alpha

* Compiled `ES6` and `CommonsJS` modules.
* Renamed `Maybe.has()` into `Maybe.which()`.
* Added support for a function argument type in `Maybe.pick()`.
* Added custom `Just.to()` signature to preserve the `Just` chain.
* Added custom `Just.onto()` signature to preserve the `Just` chain.
* Changed `Just.run()` signature to return `Just`.
* Fixed: `to()` lift function signature.

== v0.4.0

* Extracted auxiliary functions and types into the `@perfective/fp`, `@perfective/error`,
`@perfective/value`, `@perfective/real`, and `@perfective/object` packages.
* Renamed the `Maybe.with()` into `Maybe.has()`.
* Removed the `Maybe.index()` method
(use functions from the `@perfective/array` package instead).
* Added the `Maybe.run()` method.
* Added functors for each `Maybe` method
(can be used in the `map()`/`lift()` methods).

== v0.3.4

* Removed `Maybe.then()` as it conflicts with `Promise.then()` and `PromiseLike<T>`.

== v0.3.3

* Added `Maybe.lift()` method to map to the plain `Maybe` value.
* Added `sideEffects: false` flag to ensure Webpack tree-shaking.

== v0.3.2

* Add `Maybe.onto()` as a bind operator.
* Add `Maybe.to()` as a mapping operator.
* Fix: require an argument in the `optional()` unit function.

== v0.3.1

* Add `…ValueOrThrow()` unpacking functions:
** `definedValueOrThrow`/`undefinedValueOrThrow`,
** `notNullValueOrThrow`/`nullValueOrThrow`,
** `presentValueOrThrow`/`absentValueOrThrow`.
* Fix: export functions and types added in the previous version.

== v0.3.0

* Move fallback support from `Maybe.otherwise()` to `Maybe.or()`.
* Add `Just<T>`, `Nothing<T>`, and `Nil<T>` sealed classes.
* Provide a fallback to `Just<T>` in `Maybe.otherwise()` to allow chaining after a fallback.
* Keep context of `Nothing<T>` and `Nil<T>` through the chain.
* Add `Maybe.when()` method to filter based on an outside values.
* Add `Maybe.with()` method to filter based on a provided type-guard:
** `definedProperty()`/`undefinedProperty()`,
** `notNullProperty()`/`nullProperty()`,
** `presentProperty()`/`absentProperty()`.
* Add `throws()` function.
* Add `isError()` function.
* Add `…ValueOrPanic()` unpacking functions:
** `definedValueOrPanic`/`undefinedValueOrPanic`,
** `notNullValueOrPanic`/`nullValueOrPanic`,
** `presentValueOrPanic`/`absentValueOrPanic`.
* Fix: explicitly use `undefined` in type guards.
* Fix: filter out absent types from `Maybe.pick()` signature.
* Fix: filter out absent types from `Maybe.index()` signature.

== v0.2.3

* Add object properties type-guards:
** `hasDefinedProperty()`;
** `hasUndefinedProperty()`;
** `hasNotNullProperty()`;
** `hasNullProperty()`;
** `hasPresentProperty()`;
** `hasAbsentProperty()`.
* Add `voidable()` function to cast `void` into `null | undefined`.
* Use the same check for `undefined` as in the compiled JS code.

== v0.2.2

* Fix: failing “no-unsafe-return” linter rule.

== v0.2.1

* Add `Maybe.index()` method to pick array elements.
* Fix: keep the absent value in `Maybe.that()` instead of always switching to `nothing()`.

== v0.2.0

* Remove `fail()` function.
* Add support for a `message?: string` parameter to the `panic()`.
* Require `value` to be explicitly passed into `new Maybe()`.
* Add functions to work with promises:
`promise()` to instantiate a promise,
and `result()` as default callback to resolve or reject a promise.

== v0.1.5

* Add `Maybe.or()` method to act as the nullish coalescing operator `??`.

== v0.1.4

* Fix: correct definition for the `Bind<T, R>` type to allow returning `undefined` and `null`.

== v0.1.3

* Fix: remove unnecessary generic type default.

== v0.1.2

* Export `Maybe<T>` class.
* Include source maps.
* Add `types` path to `package.json` to allow TypeScript imports `from '@perfective/maybe'`
instead of `from '@perfective/maybe/dist'`.

== v0.1.1

* Fix NPM documentation file.

== v0.1.0

* Added Maybe monad-like container with unit functions and full test coverage.
