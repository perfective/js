= Perfective Maybe Monad

`@perfective/maybe` package provides a Maybe monad-like container class
and a set of unit functions (`maybe`, `just`, `nothing`, etc.) to instantiate it.

== Installation

[source,bash]
----
npm install @perfective/maybe
----

== Example

[source,typescript]
----
import { fail, just } from '@perfective/maybe';

function quotient(dividend: number, divisor: number): number {
    return just(divisor)
        .that(divisor => divisor !== 0)
        .then(divisor => dividend / divisor) // <.>
        .otherwise(fail('Division by zero')); // <.>
}
----
<1> `divisor` is guaranteed to be non-zero.
<2> Returns the result or throws an `Error`.
